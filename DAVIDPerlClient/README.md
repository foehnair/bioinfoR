DAVIDPerlClient
==========================
This is an R package for DAVID Web Service (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/content.jsp?file=WS.html). It improves and encapsulates the original Perl client provided by DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/helps/WS_perl_README.txt). It automates DAVID functional analysis query in R, by submitting gene lists and saving the results to tab-delimited files in batch. Currently supported query types includes  
* Term clustering
* Term enrichment
* Gene clustering
* Gene annotation
